        <p> Hi, my name is Holley Hutto. I'm a Video and film major from Nashville, TN.
            A little fun fact about me is I wanted to be a psychiatrist, but I ended up in film and video.
            I want to be on sets of music videos. I'm here to learn more on video and film to make me better at what I
            do.

        </p>
        <p>
            I have a one year old little boy named Jude. I love taking family vacations, so my son gets to travel and learn knew things.
            I can't wait for the day to have my own house to live with my little family.

            <blockquote> “I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things
                go wrong so that
                you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself,
                and
                sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.”
                ― Marilyn Monroe
